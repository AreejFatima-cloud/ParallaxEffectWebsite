        <h2>What is a parallax effect?</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever scrolled through a page that felt dynamic? As if you were scrolling through more than one view at once? That’s a parallax effect, and it happens when the different elements of a page move at different speeds — creating a 3D depth effect.
            
            What’s often happening is that the background image will be held in place or move slowly while the images and text on the page scroll normally. </p>
           <br><br> <h2>What are the benefits of using a parallax effect?</h2>
<p>The parallax effect is a great way to enrich a site, showcase products, and create a sense of immersion. <br>

<b>3D depth: </b>By separating layers and moving them at different speeds, you trick the user’s mind into perceiving 3D depth.<br>
<b>Sense of scale: </b>Having more elements on different levels lets you differentiate them from each other and gives a sense of scale that’s usually difficult to convey with 2D static images.<br>
<b>Targeting user focus:</b> If you want to keep your users’ eyes on a specific element, scrolling effects let you seemingly animate something or everything else around it to maintain focus.<br>
<b>Break up content: </b>B2B sites frequently use parallax effects to showcase important company offerings. These sites have a lot of information, so it’s a good way to break up the content.<br>
<b>Modern design:</b> Sleek flowing designs are part of a modern web and mobile app aesthetic that companies from all industries follow. Make the most of scrolling effects to keep your designs current.<br></p>
